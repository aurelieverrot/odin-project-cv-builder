# CV BUILDER

## Description
CV Builder is made to help people creating their resume easily.
Made in React with no backend, it generate (will generate) a PDF with the entries stored in the state of each component.
Styling is made using Bootstrap (CDN version).

## OK... but why?
I am learning React by making tiny projects, following the Odin Project React course.
[Odin Project - CV Application](https://theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application)

## Wanna use it? or improve it?
You can fork this repo, then:
``` 
$ yarn install
 ``` 
Not really necessary, but it doesn't hurt right?
```
$ yarn start
```
To launch the server, and see the app in the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
